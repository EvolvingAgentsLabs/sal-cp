## ⚠️ Experimental Research Project

**Important**: This is an experimental research prototype exploring self-aware communication protocols for AI agents. It should be treated as research material rather than a production-ready system. This project will remain permanently in alpha status as ongoing research.

---

## The Problem (Our Research Hypothesis)

In distributed networks of LLMunix agents, we need standardized communication that goes beyond simple text:
- **Cognitive State Sharing**: Agents need to communicate their current thinking process
- **Resource Awareness**: Agents must share their computational load and constraints
- **Context Preservation**: Critical task context must flow between agent handoffs
- **Capability Negotiation**: Agents need to understand each other's strengths
- **Coordination Metadata**: Timing, urgency, and dependencies must be explicit

SAL-CP defines a standardized message format that all LLMunix instances use to create meaningful, context-aware agent networks.

## The Experiment: Standardized Agent-to-Agent Messaging

SAL-CP is not a single agent but a **message format specification** that all LLMunix instances implement for inter-agent communication.

### The SAL-CP Message Standard

Every message between LLMunix agents follows this structure:

```json
{
  "protocol": "SAL-CP/v1",
  "message_id": "msg_123456",
  "from": "content-writer-agent",
  "to": "market-analyst-agent",
  "timestamp": "2024-06-26T10:30:00Z",
  
  "payload": {
    "content": "Please provide competitor analysis for EcoFlow Pro",
    "task_id": "report_001",
    "priority": "high"
  },
  
  "context": {
    "cognitive_state": "DRAFTING_SECTION_3",
    "confidence_level": 0.85,
    "resource_usage": {
      "token_buffer": "80%",
      "memory_load": "moderate",
      "time_remaining": "2_hours"
    }
  },
  
  "requirements": {
    "response_format": "structured_data",
    "max_response_time": "30_minutes",
    "required_context_keys": [
      "permanent:product_strategy_2024",
      "workspace:competitor_list"
    ]
  },
  
  "metadata": {
    "thread_id": "project_ecoflow_report",
    "parent_message": "msg_123455",
    "collaboration_pattern": "research_support"
  }
}
```

### Implementation in LLMunix

The `send_message` tool in each LLMunix instance constructs SAL-CP compliant messages:

```python
# In GEMINI.md virtual tools
def send_message(recipient, content, context=None):
    """Send SAL-CP formatted message to another agent"""
    message = {
        "protocol": "SAL-CP/v1",
        "from": self.agent_id,
        "to": recipient,
        "payload": {"content": content},
        "context": {
            "cognitive_state": self.current_state,
            "confidence_level": self.task_confidence,
            "resource_usage": self.get_resource_metrics()
        },
        "metadata": {
            "thread_id": self.current_thread,
            "collaboration_pattern": self.detect_pattern()
        }
    }
    return self.message_bus.send(message)

## Key Research Features

### 🧠 Cognitive State Fields

SAL-CP defines standard fields for agents to share their thinking process:

```yaml
cognitive_states:
  - PLANNING: "Developing approach to task"
  - RESEARCHING: "Gathering information"
  - ANALYZING: "Processing and evaluating data"
  - CREATING: "Generating new content"
  - REVIEWING: "Checking and refining work"
  - BLOCKED: "Waiting for dependencies"
  - ERROR_RECOVERY: "Handling unexpected issues"

resource_metrics:
  token_buffer_usage: "Percentage of context window used"
  memory_pressure: "Available vs used memory state"
  compute_intensity: "Current processing load"
  time_constraints: "Deadline awareness"

confidence_indicators:
  task_understanding: 0.0-1.0
  capability_match: 0.0-1.0
  success_probability: 0.0-1.0
  uncertainty_areas: ["specific unknowns"]
```

### 📊 Context Preservation Across Handoffs

SAL-CP ensures critical context flows between agents:

```json
{
  "context_transfer": {
    "task_history": [
      {
        "agent": "router",
        "action": "classified_as_legal_task",
        "timestamp": "10:30:00"
      },
      {
        "agent": "marketplace",
        "action": "auction_completed",
        "winner": "legal_expert",
        "timestamp": "10:30:45"
      }
    ],
    "shared_memory_keys": [
      "workspace:project_requirements",
      "permanent:client_preferences",
      "workspace:draft_sections_completed"
    ],
    "task_dependencies": {
      "upstream": ["data_gathering_complete"],
      "downstream": ["final_review_needed"],
      "parallel": ["graphics_generation"]
    },
    "quality_requirements": {
      "accuracy": "legal_grade",
      "format": "formal_report",
      "citations": "bluebook_standard"
    }
  }
}
```

### 🤝 Message Types and Patterns

SAL-CP defines standard message types for common agent interactions:

```yaml
message_types:
  # Task delegation
  TASK_REQUEST: "Router → Worker: Please handle this task"
  TASK_ACCEPTANCE: "Worker → Router: I can handle this"
  TASK_REJECTION: "Worker → Router: Outside my capabilities"
  
  # Marketplace interactions  
  REQUEST_FOR_BID: "Marketplace → All: Who can do this?"
  BID_SUBMISSION: "Worker → Marketplace: I bid $X"
  BID_AWARD: "Marketplace → Worker: You won, proceed"
  
  # Collaboration
  CONTEXT_QUERY: "Agent A → Agent B: Need info about X"
  CONTEXT_SHARE: "Agent B → Agent A: Here's what I know"
  PROGRESS_UPDATE: "Worker → Observer: 50% complete"
  
  # Coordination
  DEPENDENCY_WAIT: "Agent → Network: Blocked on task Y"
  DEPENDENCY_READY: "Agent → Waiting: Task Y complete"
  HANDOFF: "Agent A → Agent B: Taking over from here"

collaboration_patterns:
  sequential: "A completes, then hands to B"
  parallel: "A and B work simultaneously"
  hierarchical: "A delegates subtasks to B, C, D"
  peer_review: "A and B check each other's work"
  ensemble: "A, B, C vote on best approach"
```

### 🔄 Context Evolution Tracking

Protocol tracks how understanding evolves through interaction:

```python
class ContextEvolution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.evolution_log = []
        self.shared_understanding = {}
    
    def track_interaction(self, sender, receiver, message, outcome):
        evolution_event = {
            "timestamp": datetime.now(),
            "participants": [sender.id, receiver.id],
            "message_type": message.type,
            "understanding_before": self.shared_understanding.copy(),
            "understanding_after": outcome.new_shared_understanding,
            "learning_occurred": outcome.knowledge_gained,
            "capability_adaptations": outcome.capability_updates
        }
        self.evolution_log.append(evolution_event)
        self.shared_understanding = outcome.new_shared_understanding
```

## Integration with LLMunix

SAL-CP is built into every LLMunix instance's messaging tools:

```bash
# In your LLMunix GEMINI.md, the send_message tool automatically uses SAL-CP

# Example: Content Writer agent sending to Research agent
send_message(
    to="research-analyst",
    content="Need competitor pricing data for Q4 report",
    context={
        "cognitive_state": "DRAFTING",
        "urgency": "high",
        "required_format": "table"
    }
)
```

### Message Bus Configuration

Configure your LLMunix instances to use SAL-CP:

```yaml
# workspace/config/sal_cp.yaml
protocol:
  version: "1.0"
  strict_mode: true  # Enforce protocol compliance
  
message_bus:
  type: "filesystem"  # or "redis", "rabbitmq"
  path: "workspace/messages/"
  
agent_discovery:
  method: "broadcast"  # or "registry"
  heartbeat_interval: 30  # seconds
  
context_preservation:
  max_history_depth: 10
  shared_memory_sync: true
```

### Monitoring SAL-CP Messages

Use the protocol analyzer to inspect agent communications:

```bash
# Monitor all SAL-CP messages in real-time
python -m sal_cp.tools.monitor --path workspace/messages/

# Analyze communication patterns
python -m sal_cp.tools.analyze --report patterns

# Validate protocol compliance
python -m sal_cp.tools.validate --strict
```

## Research Examples

### Example 1: Self-Aware Research Collaboration

```python
# Multi-agent research pipeline with self-awareness
task = "Conduct systematic literature review on AI safety research"

# Agent self-reflection before collaboration
researcher.reflect_on_capabilities(task)
# -> {"confidence": 0.95, "resource_needs": "arxiv_access", "collaboration_preferences": "peer_review"}

analyst.assess_collaboration_fit(researcher, task)
# -> {"compatibility": 0.88, "complementary_skills": ["data_visualization", "statistical_analysis"]}

# Self-aware communication during collaboration
message = researcher.create_message(
    content="Found 200+ relevant papers, need help with trend analysis",
    metacommunication={
        "confidence_in_findings": 0.92,
        "processing_capacity_remaining": 0.3,
        "preferred_next_steps": "parallel_analysis",
        "quality_concerns": ["potential_bias_in_paper_selection"]
    }
)
```

### Example 2: Adaptive Communication Patterns

```python
# Protocol adapts based on agent states and task complexity
def adaptive_collaboration_demo():
    # High-stress, time-sensitive task
    urgent_task = Task(
        description="Emergency response analysis", 
        deadline="1_hour",
        complexity="high"
    )
    
    # Protocol automatically selects rapid-response pattern
    pattern = workspace.select_pattern(urgent_task, available_agents)
    # -> RapidResponsePattern: direct_communication, minimal_deliberation, expert_override_enabled
    
    # Long-term research task
    research_task = Task(
        description="Long-term AI impact assessment",
        deadline="3_months", 
        complexity="extremely_high"
    )
    
    # Protocol selects deep-collaboration pattern
    pattern = workspace.select_pattern(research_task, available_agents)
    # -> DeepCollaborationPattern: reflective_communication, multi_round_review, consensus_building
```
